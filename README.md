Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) aims to generate structured semantic summaries of images for "human-like" event understanding. Specifically, GSR task not only detects the salient activity verb (e.g. buying), but also predicts all corresponding semantic roles (e.g. agent and goods).

Inspired by object detection and image captioning tasks, existing methods typically employ a two-stage framework: 1) detect the activity verb, and then 2) predict semantic roles based on the detected verb. Obviously, this illogical framework constitutes a huge obstacle to semantic understanding. First, pre-detecting verbs solely without semantic roles inevitably fails to distinguish many similar daily activities (e.g., offering and giving, buying and selling). Second, predicting semantic roles in a closed auto-regressive manner can hardly exploit the semantic relations among the verb and roles.

## Overview
To this end, we propose a novel two-stage framework that focuses on utilizing such bidirectional relations within verbs and roles. In the first stage, instead of pre-detecting the verb, we postpone the detection step and assume a pseudo label, where an intermediate representation for each corresponding semantic role is learned from images. In the second stage, we exploit transformer layers to unearth the potential semantic relations within both verbs and semantic roles. With the help of a set of support images, an alternate learning scheme is designed to simultaneously optimize the results: update the verb using nouns corresponding to the image, and update nouns using verbs from support images. Extensive experimental results on challenging SWiG benchmarks show that our renovated framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under various metrics.

## Environment Setup
We provide instructions for environment setup.
```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate into the repository
git clone https://github.com/zhiqic/GSRFormer.git
cd GSRFormer

# Create a conda environment, activate the environment and install PyTorch via conda
conda create --name GSRFormer python=3.9              
conda activate GSRFormer
conda install pytorch==1.8.0 torchvision==0.9.0 cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c conda-forge

# Install requirements via pip
pip install -r requirements.txt                   
```

## SWiG Dataset
Annotations are given in JSON format, and annotation files are under "SWiG/SWiG_jsons/" directory. Images can be downloaded [here](https://swig-data-weights.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images_512.zip). Please download the images and store them in "SWiG/images_512/" directory.

#### Additional Details
- All images should be under "SWiG/images_512/" directory.
- train.json file is for train set.
- dev.json file is for development set.
- test.json file is for test set.

## Training
To train GSRFormer on a single node with 4 GPUs, run:
```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --use_env main.py \
           --backbone resnet50 --dataset_file swig \
		   --encoder_epochs 20 --decoder_epochs 25 \
            --preprocess True \
           --num_workers 4 --num_enc_layers 6 --num_dec_layers 5 \
            --dropout 0.15 --hidden_dim 512 --output_dir GSRFormer
```

- We use AdamW optimizer with learning rate 10<sup>-4</sup> (10<sup>-5</sup> for backbone), weight decay 10<sup>-4</sup> and Î² = (0.9, 0.999).    
    - Those learning rates are divided by 10 at epoch 30.
- Random Color Jittering, Random Gray Scaling, Random Scaling and Random Horizontal Flipping are used for augmentation.

## Evaluation
```bash
python main.py --output_dir GSRFormer --dev
python main.py --output_dir GSRFormer --test
```

## Inference
To run an inference on a custom image, run:
```bash
python inference.py --image_path inference/filename.jpg \
                    --output_dir inference
```
